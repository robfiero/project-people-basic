# project-people-basic
The plan is for several versions of the "people" project, each one will focus on different capabilities.  They may build off each other, or they may branch, I'm not sure yet.  The basic version will have 0..n people, who can have 0..n addresses, and 0..n jobs with various CLI commands to support it.
